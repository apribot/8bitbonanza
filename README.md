# 8bitbonanza
musical experiment

A lightweight, dirty 8bit 'VCO' for the Raspberry Pi.

weird algorithms create u8int waveforms based on a 't' counter in a loop.

TODO:
- midi-over-usb support
- longer wave/sample generation and better handling of feeding pyaudio the frames
- if i get really weird, maybe ADSR... maybe a bad low-pass filter
